## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### **Backend Technologies**

#### Laravel Framework (v12.x)
- **MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Eloquent ORM**: Database abstraction and relationships
- **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze for secure login/registration
- **Authorization**: Middleware for role-based access control

- **Relationships**:
  - User → Reservations (One-to-Many)
  - Reservation → ReservationItems (One-to-Many)
  - ReservationItem → Equipment (Many-to-One)
  - User → Department (Many-to-One)
  - User → Notifications (One-to-Many)

#### Key Laravel Packages

### **Frontend Technologies**

#### Vue.js 3 (Composition API)
- **Component-Based**: Reusable UI components
- **Reactive Data**: Real-time UI updates
- **Single Page Application**: Fast, smooth navigation
- **Composition API**: Modern, maintainable code structure

#### Inertia.js

---

### **Architecture Patterns**

#### MVC (Model-View-Controller)
```
Models (app/Models/) → Business logic and database interactions
Views (resources/js/Pages/) → User interface components
Controllers (app/Http/Controllers/) → Request handling and response
```

#### Service Layer Pattern
```
Controllers → Services → Models
- Services handle complex business logic
- Controllers remain thin and focused
- Example: ReservationService handles all reservation workflows
```

#### Repository Pattern (Planned)
```
Controllers → Repositories → Models
- Abstraction layer for data access
- Easier testing and mocking
- Planned for future enhancement
```

#### Event-Driven Architecture
```
Action → Event → Listener → Notification
- ReservationStatusUpdated event
- Broadcast to relevant users
- Trigger email notifications (future)
```

---

### **Performance Optimizations**

#### Database Optimization
- **Indexes**: Critical fields indexed for fast queries
  - `users`: role, department_id, email
  - `reservations`: status, reservation_date, user_id
  - `equipment`: status, category
  - `notifications`: is_read, type
- **Eager Loading**: Prevent N+1 query problems
- **Query Optimization**: Selective field loading
- **Pagination**: Limit result sets

#### Caching Strategy
- **Cache Keys**:
  - `user_{id}_reservations`: User's reservations (5 min TTL)
  - `reservation_statistics`: System stats (5 min TTL)
  - `dashboard_stats`: Dashboard data (5 min TTL)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic on data changes
- **Session Storage**: User preferences

#### Frontend Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy load pages and components
- **Asset Optimization**: Vite bundling and minification
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed equipment images
- **Lazy Loading**: Load images as they appear in viewport

- **API Endpoints**: Custom throttling per route

#### Data Protection
- **Soft Deletes**: Recoverable deletions
- **Audit Trails**: Complete activity logging
- **Secure File Storage**: Restricted file access
